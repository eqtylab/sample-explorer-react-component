# Explorer React Component Sample

This sample application uses the EQTY [Lineage Explorer](https://explorer.eqtylab.io) as a React Component using the [npm package](https://github.com/eqtylab/integrity-monorepo/pkgs/npm/explorer).

## Getting started

```
export GITHUB_PACKAGES_READ=<access_token>

yarn install
yarn run start
```

## Customization

See [customization options](https://docs.eqtylab.io/docs/lineage-explorer-customizations/). Note that `display` and `manifests` customization does not apply to the React Component, but `nodeOverrides` is the same and the standalone application.
